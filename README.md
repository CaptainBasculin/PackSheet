## What's this?

This is a python script made to extract Beatmap Packs for the data it contains, being compatible with . 

## Prequisites for running?

Install Python 3 if you haven't, make sure to select "Add to PATH" while installing. 

Install the prequisites with this command after that

>pip install py7zr openpyxl

## How do I run it?

Place the repository contents to a seperate folder, and head to that directory through command line.

After putting the files you want parsed to to the folder "putPackHere", run the program with this

>python3 main.py

After the export operation is done, you can CTRL+C to close the program. On the output folder there should be output.xlsx file, which can be directly imported to Google Slides and through there you can simply copy paste its contents. 

Code's tested on Linux, I'll update when I test it on Windows too. It theoratically should.
